# **60-Day Plan: Content & Product Marketing at Mintlify**

## **What I See After Researching Mintlify**

You've built something genuinely impressive. Serving 100M+ developers with customers like Anthropic and Cursor isn't luck \- it's proof that you're solving real documentation pain points at scale. The $18.5M Series A and growth trajectory show strong product-market fit.

But there's a disconnect between your product strength and how you're communicating it. You have the technical depth and customer proof points that developer audiences crave, yet your content feels like it's holding back from being as technical and specific as it could be.

The AI-native positioning is a real competitive moat \- you were building AI documentation before it was trendy. But right now, GitBook's marketing makes it sound like they invented AI docs. That's a messaging problem, not a product problem.

## **Specific Opportunities I See**

**Your AI messaging lacks concrete examples.** Your homepage mentions "AI-powered" but doesn't show me exactly what that means. Developers want to know: Does your AI catch when my API examples are outdated? Can it spot when my SDK docs contradict my REST API docs? Those specifics would differentiate you from competitors just adding ChatGPT wrappers.

**Case studies focus on outcomes without showing the work.** The Ramp case study mentions "beautiful documentation" but I want to know: How much engineering time did they save monthly? Did support tickets about API implementation drop? Developers share case studies that include the messy technical details, not just the happy ending.

**You're not directly addressing the Docusaurus question.** Every developer evaluating docs tools wonders "Why not just use the free option?" Your content dances around this instead of tackling it head-on. Developers respect honest trade-off discussions more than generic positioning.

**Content targets everyone and converts no one.** Your blog post about "documentation best practices" tries to appeal to developers, PMs, and technical writers simultaneously. But developers care about implementation speed, PMs care about support ticket reduction, and technical writers care about workflow efficiency. Pick one audience per piece.

**You're creating content for "developers" but developers aren't one audience.** The backend engineer implementing your API, the DevOps person setting up docs infrastructure, and the technical writer maintaining SDK documentation all have different pain points and decision-making authority. Your current content tries to speak to all of them simultaneously, which means it doesn't truly resonate with any of them. I'd want to map out who actually influences documentation tool decisions at your target companies and create content that speaks directly to their specific concerns.

## **My 60-Day Execution Plan**

### **Week 1: Get Real Customer Intel (Days 1-5)**

**Day 1-2: Deep product experience**

* Set up 3 different Mintlify instances: API docs, SDK reference, internal wiki  
* Document every friction point I hit (these become content topics)  
* Compare setup time and final result to GitBook and Docusaurus

**Day 3-5: Customer reality check**

* Interview customer who evaluated GitBook before choosing Mintlify (understand what almost lost the deal)  
* Talk to customer who migrated from Confluence/Notion (understand the migration pain points)  
* Speak with long-term customer about what keeps them from churning (understand retention drivers)

**Day 4-5: ICP and persona validation**

* Interview customer success about who actually champions Mintlify internally (is it always developers? or sometimes technical writers? PMs?)  
* Ask sales team: "Who in the room usually says yes/no to paying for docs tools?"  
* Map out the actual buyer journey: Who discovers us → Who evaluates us → Who approves purchase → Who implements

### **Week 2: Competitive Intelligence (Days 8-12)**

**Day 8-9: Competitor content audit**

* Analyze GitBook's last 10 blog posts \- what developer pain points are they targeting?  
* Review Docusaurus community discussions \- what complaints come up repeatedly?  
* Document specific claims competitors make that we need to address

**Day 10-12: Sales team intelligence**

* Shadow 2 sales calls to hear live competitive objections  
* Interview sales team about the "GitBook question" \- what usually wins that conversation?  
* Document exact phrases prospects use when comparing options

### **Week 3: Content That Addresses Real Decisions (Days 15-19)**

**Day 15-17: Write "Why We Chose Mintlify Over Docusaurus"**

* Interview engineering team that made this decision for specific trade-offs  
* Include setup time comparison, maintenance overhead, customization limits  
* Share in r/webdev and Dev.to with context about the evaluation process

**Day 18-19: Create "Hidden Costs of 'Free' Documentation Tools"**

* Calculate actual engineering time costs for Docusaurus maintenance  
* Include hosting, security updates, plugin compatibility issues  
* Make it data-driven, not just theoretical

### **Week 4: AI Value Demonstration (Days 22-26)**

**Day 22-24: Technical AI deep-dive**

* Write "How Mintlify's AI Catches Documentation Errors Humans Miss"  
* Include specific examples: outdated code samples, inconsistent terminology, broken links  
* Show side-by-side comparison of AI-generated vs. manually written docs

**Day 25-26: Customer AI case study**

* Interview customer about specific AI features that save them time  
* Get concrete metrics: "AI updates reduced our docs maintenance from 8 hours/week to 2 hours/week"  
* Include screenshots of AI suggestions in action

### **Week 5-6: Distribution & Amplification (Days 29-40)**

**Day 29-33: Strategic content promotion**

* Share AI deep-dive in communities where developers discuss documentation tools  
* Email case study to prospects currently evaluating docs platforms  
* Get customers to share their experience on Twitter/LinkedIn

**Day 34-40: Double down on what works**

* Analyze which content drove qualified traffic and trials  
* Create follow-up content expanding on successful topics  
* Kill or rework content that got no engagement

### **Week 7-8: Sales Enablement & Optimization (Days 43-54)**

**Day 43-47: Sales team resources**

* Create demo script for "Mintlify vs. Docusaurus" conversation  
* Develop objection handling guide based on actual customer conversations  
* Record 5-minute video showing AI features that close deals

**Day 48-54: Content optimization**

* A/B test different value propositions on key landing pages  
* Optimize based on trial conversion data, not just traffic  
* Document what messaging resonates with each audience type

### **Week 9: Results & Planning (Days 57-60)**

**Day 57-60: Measurement and next quarter planning**

* Compile specific business impact: trials from content, sales assets used, customer insights gathered  
* Document what worked vs. what I thought would work  
* Create Q2 content plan based on real performance data

## **My Working Assumptions (That Need Validation)**

**What I think is true:**

* Your biggest competitor is "do nothing" \- most teams tolerate bad docs rather than switching tools  
* Developers discover you through word-of-mouth and product-led growth, not content marketing  
* Your AI features genuinely save time, but you're not communicating the specific ways how  
* Price objections are really about justifying the value of paid tools vs. free alternatives

**What I need to test:**

* Do developers actually care about AI in documentation, or is it just a nice-to-have?  
* Which specific competitive advantages matter most in real buying decisions?  
* Are we losing deals on price, features, or credibility/trust?

**Realistic 60-day outcomes:**

* 2-3 pieces of content that developers share organically in Slack channels  
* Sales team has specific tools to handle GitBook/Docusaurus objections  
* One customer case study with metrics that prospects actually find credible  
* Clear understanding of which messaging resonates with each audience segment

## **Questions:**

**Customer access and constraints:**

* Which customers would be willing to do detailed case studies?  
* What's the approval process for customer stories and case studies?  
* Are there any legal/compliance restrictions on sharing customer metrics?

**Current performance baseline:**

* Which existing content pieces have driven actual trial conversions?  
* What does current organic traffic look like for developer-intent keywords?  
* How often do sales calls mention specific competitors?

**Resource and budget reality:**

* What tools are available for content creation and analytics?  
* Can I get engineering time for basic tracking and landing page updates?  
* Is there budget for customer incentives or freelance help with content production?

## **What I Won't Do (Initially)**

Launch a newsletter until I have content people actually want to read weekly. Build community presence until I consistently create content that gets shared. Set up advanced attribution tracking until I understand which basic metrics matter most.

The goal isn't to increase content marketing KPIs \- it's to create content that makes prospects think "These people actually understand our documentation challenges" instead of "Great, another generic SaaS blog."

I might be wrong about some of these priorities based on internal data I don't have access to yet. But from external research, it looks like you have a great product that could be positioned more aggressively against the specific alternatives developers are actually considering.
